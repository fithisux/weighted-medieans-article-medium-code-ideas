# Experiments with Weighted medians
## _SQL weighted medians fast and easy_


The purpose of this repository is to host code, snippets and ways to run the examples from the article.

There is a docker compose file or PostgreSQL 13 + pgTap.

With postgresql you connect to a DB though the Azure Data Studio notebook.

Please do a "Run All" in Data sttudio. The intent is to keep article simple, i did not include any Flyway.

Maybe in the future I will add Flyway.

After you do a run all. you can either run tests 

(see https://github.com/fithisux/weighted-medieans-article-medium-code-ideas/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

or start reading the notebook.

Sooner or later the Medium article will give information in a more digestible form.
