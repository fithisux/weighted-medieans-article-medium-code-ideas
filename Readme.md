# Experiments with Weighted medians
## _SQL weighted medians fast and easy_


The purpose of this repository is to host code, figures and Latex code that support the article

"Quick and dirty medians on aggregated data. From the obscure to the obvious." on Medium (https://medium.com/)

There is a docker compose file or PostgreSQL 13 + a pgTap setup.

You connect to the PostgreSQL instance through the Azure Data Studio notebook.

Please do a "Run All" in Azure Data Studio. The intent is to keep article simple, i did not include any Flyway.

Maybe in the future I will add Flyway.

After you do a run all. you can either run tests (see the artickle too)

(see https://github.com/fithisux/weighted-medieans-article-medium-code-ideas/blob/master/code/docker-compose.yml)

or start reading the notebook.
